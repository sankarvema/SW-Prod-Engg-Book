# SOLID Principles

- **Single responsibility principle**
a class should have only a single responsibility (i.e. only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class).
- **Open/closed principle**
"software entities â€¦ should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
- **Liskov substitution principle**
"objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." See also design by contract.
- **Interface segregation principle**
"many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."
- **Dependency inversion principle**
one should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."
