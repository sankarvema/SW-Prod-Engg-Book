# Cargo Cult Programming

[According to Wikipedia,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming) “Cargo cult programming is a style of computer programming characterized by the ritual inclusion of code or program structures that serve no real purpose.”

In other words, it’s when a developer writes code without really understanding it. The developer may use a very trial-and-error approach—maybe copy and paste some code from somewhere else and then tweak it and test it until works, or sort of works. Then the developer will stop tweaking the code, for fear it will stop working. In the process, maybe they leave some lines of code that don’t do anything.

Or maybe they tried to use an idiom they picked up from another developer while failing to understand that the contexts are different and it’s useless in the current situation.

Finally, it might just be lack of education: maybe the developer has a poor mental model of how the tools they’re using really work.
