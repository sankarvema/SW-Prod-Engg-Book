# DevOps Intro

## Toolset


1. Infrastructure as code — Ansible, Terraform, Puppet, Chef
- CI/CD — Jenkins, TeamCity, Shippable, Bamboo, Azure DevOps
- Test automation — Selenium, Cucumber, Apache JMeter
- Containerization — Docker, Rocket, Unik
- Orchestration — Kubernetes, Swarm, Mesos
- Software deployment — Elastic Beanstalk, Octopus, Vamp
- Measurement — NewRelic, Kibana, Datadog, DynaTrace
- ChatOps — Hubot, Lita, Cog


## Metrics

## DevOps vs. IT Ops

1. Responsibilities of ITOps includes ensuring security, compliance, and reliability, whereas DevOps is responsible for developing and deploying new products to the end-user.
- ITOps ensures safety and security for all business needs using the network, DevOps walks a line between flexibility and the rigorous testing and communication that comes with deploying new software.


## Agile vs. DevOps

1. **Speed**: Agile is all about rapid and frequent deployment, but this is rarely the goal, or even part of it, for DevOps.
Creating vs. Deploying: Developing software is inherent to Agile, but DevOps is concerned with the appropriate deployment of said software. For the record, DevOps can deploy software that was developed in any number of approaches, including Agile and non-Agile theories, like the Waterfall approach, which is still appropriate for certain projects.
- **Specialization**: Agile is an equal opportunity team – every member of the scrum can do every job within the team, which prevents slowdowns and bottlenecks. DevOps, on the other hand, assumes separate teams for development and operations, and people stay within their teams, but they all communicate frequently.
- **Communication and documentation**: Daily, informal meetings are at the heart of Agile approaches, so each team member can share progress, daily goals, and indicate help when needed. These scrums are not meant to go over documentation or milestones and metrics. DevOps meeting are not daily, but they require a lot of documentation in order to communicate software deployment to all relevant teams.
- **Documentation**: Agile teams don’t codify their meeting minutes or other communications – often preferring lo-fi methods of simple pen and paper. DevOps, on the other hand, requires design documents and specs in order to fully understand a software release.
- **Team size**: Staying small is at the core of Agile – the smaller the team, the fewer people on it, the faster they can move, even if they are contributing to a larger effort. DevOps, on the other hand, will have many teams that work together and each team can realistically practice different theories.
- **Scheduling**: Agile teams work in short, predetermined amounts of time, known as sprints. Sprints rarely last longer than a month, and often can be as short as a week. DevOps, on the other hand, values maximum reliability, so they focus on a long-term schedule that minimizes business disruptions.
Automation: This is the heart of DevOps, as their overall goal is to minimize disruptions and maximize efficiency, especially when deploying software. Agile doesn’t require automation.
