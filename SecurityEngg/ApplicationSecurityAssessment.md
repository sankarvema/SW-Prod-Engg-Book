# Security Risk Assessment

## Key Questions

- Why are breaches continuing despite deploying cutting-edge solutions supported by compliance to thwart the attacks?
- Are applications more secure relative to current threats or less secure?
- How much more security is required?
- What is the current level of risk posed by application security?
- Can the security budget be decreased or should it be increased? If increased, to what extent is risk reduced?
- What is the applications’ change in the risk level before and after the deployment of innovative security measures?

Real application security risk is perceived and not measured. The business is unaware of its applications’ susceptibility to attack. This is the main reason for continued attacks on applications despite deploying robust security measures

- What path could an attacker take to get inside the application?
- What tools are required to defeat the existing security measure?
- What are the possible signs of an attack particular to each category of application?
- Can existing security measures detect the attack?

## Risk Assessment Matrix

A risk assessment matrix is a project management tool that allows a single page – quick view of the probable risks evaluated in terms of the likelihood or probability of the risk and the severity of the consequences.

## Standard Metrics & Data Collection

### Application Security Risk Metrics

````
Risk = (Probability or likelihood of Attack ) x (Impact or consequence of Attack)
```

Probability or likelihood can be categorized into

1. Definite: A risk that is almost certain to show-up during project execution. If you’re looking at percentages a risk that is more than 80% likely to cause problems will fall under this category.
2. Likely: Risks that have 60-80% chances of occurrence can be grouped as likely.
3. Occasional: Risks which have a near 50/50 probability of occurrence.
4. Seldom: Risks that have a low probability of occurrence but still can not be ruled out completely.
5. Unlikely: Rare and exceptional risks which have a less than 10% chance of occurrence.

Similarly, impact or consequence can be categorized combination

1. Insignificant: Risks that will cause a near negligible amount of damage to the overall progress of the project.
2. Marginal: If a risk will result in some damage, but the extent of damage is not too significant and is not likely to make much of a difference to the overall progress of the project.
3. Moderate: Risks which do not impose a great threat, but yet a sizable damage can be classified as moderate.
4. Critical: Risks with significantly large consequences which can lead to a great amount of loss are classified as critical.
5. Catastrophic: These are the risks which can make the project completely unproductive and unfruitful, and must be a top priority during risk management.
