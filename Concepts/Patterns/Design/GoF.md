# Gang of Four Patterns

1. Creational
  - Abstract factory	Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.	Yes	Yes	N/A
  - Builder	Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.	Yes	No	N/A
  - Dependency Injection	A class accepts the objects it requires from an injector instead of creating the objects directly.	No	No	N/A
  - Factory method	Define an interface for creating a single object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.	Yes	Yes	N/A
  - Lazy initialization	Tactic of delaying the creation of an object, the calculation of a value, or some other expensive process until the first time it is needed. This pattern appears in the GoF catalog as "virtual proxy", an implementation strategy for the Proxy pattern.	No	No	PoEAA[14]
  - Multiton	Ensure a class has only named instances, and provide a global point of access to them.	No	No	N/A
  - Object pool	Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use. Can be considered a generalisation of connection pool and thread pool patterns.	No	No	N/A
  - Prototype	Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects from the 'skeleton' of an existing object, thus boosting performance and keeping memory footprints to a minimum.	Yes	No	N/A
  - Resource acquisition is initialization (RAII)	Ensure that resources are properly released by tying them to the lifespan of suitable objects.	No	No	N/A
  - Singleton	Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
- Structural
- Behavioral
- Concurrency
